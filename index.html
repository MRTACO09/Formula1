            <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
            <p>Formula 1 Racing is a fun two person game where you try to go around the track as many times as possible before your opponent.</p>
            <p><strong>How To Play</strong></p>
            <p>If you are drivng the red car than you use WASD. And to change gears you use Q as the clutch and gears are 123.</p>
            <p>If you are driving the blue/black car than you use Arrow Keys. And to chnage gears you use P as the clutch and gears are 890.</p>
            <p><strong>Training Mode</strong></p>
            <p>This is where you can test your skills and try to get your best lap time possible. This is a one person mode if you cannot find someone to play with.</p>
            <p><strong>Race Mode</strong></p>
            <p>This is where you can play against another person in the room. Once you have completed the first lap the lap counter will appear. You and your partner can make a collective descion on how mnay laps to do. (This is not the finished product, so no cheating! 😏)</p>
